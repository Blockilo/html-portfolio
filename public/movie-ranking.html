<h1>The Best Movies According to Tizian</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King</h3>
<p>This is an absolute banger movie wich everyone has to watch before dying</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>Another great Movie from the Lord of the Rings series but less epic than part three</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The two Towers</h3>
<p>The weakest of the three but still much better than your bonobo average movie</p>
